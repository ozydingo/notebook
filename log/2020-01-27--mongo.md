* mongo upgrade
* gem limitations (simple-form, activemodel)
* ibm mongo deployment
  * ibm cloud monitor tool builder
* chef updates
  * secrets, lazy blocks, execution order
* "why isn't my change doing anything" bug because of a buried grep-replace script
* 4 methods of constructing 5 different mongoid.yml files
  * dev, circleci, real staging, almost-real staging, production
* app mongo vs console mongo
  * forking app servers via phusion interacting with mongoid 5
* two tickets with ibm and two with ey
  * ey guy, despite request, goes off and modifies our environment without telling me what he's doing
  * ey advice was mostly useless and occasionally dead wrong
    * yaml dereferencing, ruby shell-outs, mongoid host order
* busted ey dashboard (apply not working)
* on staging: local mongo auth bugs
* hot-deploy-cowboy modifying *production* mongoid.yml LIVE
* moving the sprint board borked my comments that had very valuable information!!
* export "modified" hash key order --literally the only time i've been bitten by this, believe it or not -- causing data comparison to fail!

tangential:

* ditching transcoding despite really good momentum and my own excitement
* still required context switching to order-form
