## Prerequisites

These settings assume you want outbound internet access in your batch job.

Create or choose a VPC. Make sure it has a valid route table. It should have an Network ACL that allows outbound traffic (to dockerhub).

Create or choose a subnet within this VPC. It does not need auto-assign public ipv4.

Create or choose an Internet Gateway.

The Subnet needs a route table, which can be the VPC's default route table. The route table needs a route with access to an InternetGateway: add a route 0.0.0.0/0 => igw

Create or choose a security group with all-traffic outbound permission.

## Batch resources

Create a Compute Environment. Attach it to the chosen subnet and security group.

Create Job Queue, and attach it to the Compute Environment.

Create a Job Definition. Attach it to the Job Queue and enable "auto-assign public IP"

Submit a job.
